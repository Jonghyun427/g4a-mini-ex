                                                  <li>First, you would want to check the contents of the website or news.</li>
                                                  <li>Next, would want to check typo, clear misinformation and details. If there are many, then it is probably a 10 year old trying to get famous.</li>
                                                  <li>Then, you would want to check the domain or news article you are researching on, if its a popular website such as New York Times, then you could pretty uch assure that this website is safe, but if the domain is strange and out of context, its probably not very trustable and sketchy.</li>
                                                  <li>Finally, is it secure? If it is HTTP not, HTTPS, you might have a problem.</li>
                                                  <li>Now, enjoy being safe!</li>
